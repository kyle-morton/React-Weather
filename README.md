# React Jumpstart

Simple project for quickly getting a React/Webpack/Babel project off the ground.

Notes
--------------
1) run 'npm install' to install missing npm packages

2) run 'npm run-script build' to manually build via webpack

3) run 'npm run-script watch' to tell webpack to watch your files for new changes, then build

4) run 'npm start' to start the web server and display your page. The root page can be configured for this in the webpack.config.js file. This will refresh on each change to the project.
