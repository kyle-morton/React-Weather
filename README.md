# React Weather App

Small react app using some of the basic skills I've picked up so far (components, props, etc). Displays a real-time 7 day forecast for the given zip-code (defaults to Little Rock, AR).

Notes
--------------
1) run 'npm install' to install missing npm packages

2) run 'npm run-script build' to manually build via webpack

3) run 'npm run-script watch' to tell webpack to watch your files for new changes, then build

4) run 'npm start' to start the web server and display your page. The root page can be configured for this in the webpack.config.js file. This will refresh on each change to the project.
